# Weight a minute...

## What is this?

I plan on using this application to make a habit of tracking my weight everyday, since one of my #QuarantineGoals is to cut the weight I've gained over the last few weeks of the Spring 2020 semester.

## Goals

* **Simple**: It should only support the following features **initially**: logging weight on a date, viewing weight on a date, updating weight on a date, and viewing to-be-determined aggregations on weights over a range of dates (maybe some data viz here).
* **Extensible**: In case I end up wanting to add more features in the future.
* **Aesthetic**: Should be pretty enough to use as a browser homepage.

## Running the application

## Known TODOs

* Certain operations will return a success message, even though they don't do anything, e.g. updating or deleting when there isn't a value for a date in the DB
* Re-factor components to use container pattern or something similar
* Build
* Write tests
